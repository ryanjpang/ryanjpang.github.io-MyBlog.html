          <p> Blog Post Three will be about the article Why Aren’t You Asking Questions? By Janice Gervais on the website
            A List Apart. The article starts off by creating an imaginary scenario of you being at your first meeting as
            a lead designer on a project. While the client recites her wish list in regards to the project, the lead designer
            doodles and fails to engage with her client for what needs to be done. The article then leads into advice on what
            a good designer will do. The main focus of the article addresses the role of a good designer and the importance of
            asking good questions.
              Through the article I learned better ways to address the client and what questions to ask professionally. In my
            field of work, I always forget to ask what exactly needs to be asked and the article presents very in depth and
            specific questions that usually slip through a meeting with the client. Yet those details that do are the ones that
            are vital to your client’s needs.  Questions that were asked were like, “Who exactly do you anticipate will be using
            this website? What problem is this website solving for them? What will they accomplish by using this website? What
            are their main points?”
              Many designers, not only at school but also even in the professional workplace still have this issue of not speaking
            up. Constructive criticism is crucial in the work place and when in early design stages at school, it is most
            important. Habits like these will carry out in to your careers and may be quite detrimental to your performance or
            make the difference between your client picking somebody else over you. As far as web design goes, asking the right
            questions will help me immensely, so planning ahead of what questions are needed to be asked will be imperative.</p>
